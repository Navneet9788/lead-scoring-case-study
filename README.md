# Lead-Scoring-Case-Study  

## Problem Statement  

X Education, an online education provider for professionals, attracts visitors via websites, search engines, and referrals. Leads are generated when visitors fill out a contact form. However, only 30% of leads convert into customers, resulting in wasted sales team efforts on uninterested or unready leads.  

To address this, X Education aims to identify *'Hot Leads'* with a high conversion probability. By prioritizing these leads, the company hopes to boost efficiency and achieve a target of *80% lead conversion*.  

Your task: Build a model to assign lead scores based on demographics, behavior, and preferences, helping the sales team focus on the best leads.

## Data  

- Dataset includes attributes such as:
  - *Lead Source*  
  - *Total Time Spent on Website*  
  - *Total Visits*  
  - *Last Activity*  

- *Target Variable*: Converted  
  - 1: Lead converted  
  - 0: Lead not converted  

- Some categorical variables have a 'Select' value (equivalent to missing data) that must be handled appropriately.

## Goals of the Case Study  

1. *Build a logistic regression model* to assign lead scores (0-100):  
   - Higher score = High probability of conversion (Hot Lead)  
   - Lower score = Low probability of conversion (Cold Lead)  

2. Ensure the model is adaptable to future requirements:  
   - Address additional problems provided in a separate document.  
   - Include these solutions in the final recommendations and presentation.
