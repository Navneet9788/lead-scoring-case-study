Problem Statement:
X Education, an online education provider for professionals, attracts visitors via websites, search engines, and referrals. Leads are generated when visitors fill out a contact form. However, only 30% of leads convert into customers, resulting in wasted sales team efforts on uninterested or unready leads.
To address this, X Education aims to identify 'Hot Leads' with a high conversion probability. By prioritizing these leads, the company hopes to boost efficiency and achieve a target of 80% lead conversion. You are tasked with building a model to assign lead scores based on demographics, behavior, and preferences, helping the sales team focus on the best leads.
Data:
The dataset includes attributes like Lead Source, Total Time Spent on Website, Total Visits, and Last Activity. The target variable, 'Converted,' is 1 for converted leads and 0 for non-converted leads.
Some categorical variables have a 'Select' value, indicating missing data, which needs to be addressed.
Goals of the Case Study:
Create a logistic regression model to assign lead scores (0-100) that indicate the likelihood of conversion. Higher scores represent hot leads, and lower scores indicate cold leads.
Ensure the model is adaptable to future business needs, addressing additional requirements provided in a separate document. These adjustments should also be included in the final presentation and recommendations.
